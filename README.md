# SM60 WGBS Thesis
- This repo contains analysis scripts and results for my thesis submitted as part of the requirements for the Masters of Science (SM60) degree in Biostatistics at [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/).
- My thesis is titled: *Investigating and adjusting for biases in whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data for differential DNA methylation analysis.*
- The final written thesis report along with its formal supplementary material can be found under `/report`. 
- In place of actual data, the scripts used to download and process the data are in `/data` (due to limited storage space).
- R code for all data wrangling and analyses are in `/analysis`. --> store functions under a subdirectory.
- Individual outputs of the main figures used in writing and presenting of the thesis are stored under `/main_figs`.
- Additional/ad hoc data visualizations are in `/supp_figs`.

Hope you enjoy my thesis!
